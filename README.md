# Mazda MX-5 ND Passenger Occupancy Sensor Emulator built with Arduino

## Description

This Arduino program is emulating the MX-5 ND passenger occupancy sensor. It is meant to be used when the original seat is removed together with the OEM sensor.

The code allows for having a switch with which you can toggle the occupancy state, so when there is a passenger in the car, the SRS system can be notified that the airbags should deploy.

This Arduino program is a modification of [Timurrrr's "fake car"](https://github.com/timurrrr/RaceChronoDiyBleDevice#testing-with-a-fake-car) code to fake a Mazda MX-5 ND. Please see Timurrrr's instructions how to assemble and use the sender.
